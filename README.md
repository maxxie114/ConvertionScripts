# ConvertionScripts
These are some useful conversion scripts between binary, hex, decimal, other bases, and even floating points

These scripts are all written in python, and they are here as a 
placeholder, and if anyone else want to use these scripts, go ahead

There are also some codes that are some project I did for fun or for 
research purpose.
